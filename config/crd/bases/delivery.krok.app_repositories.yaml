                          this list to retrieve the next set of available objects.

                          If the list request contained label or field selectors,
                          then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field
                          will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If
                          the list is complete (either because it is not chunking
                          or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more
                          remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted
                          during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set
                          this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is
                          *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not
                          rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.
